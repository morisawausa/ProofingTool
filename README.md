# Occupant Proofing Tool

*Note: This plugin is currently actively developed and is not feature complete.*

This Glyphs Plugin helps you output proofs directly from Glyphs. The plugin focuses on generating form comparison proofs like waterfalls, rather than proofs that help you proof typesetting and opentype features. These capabilities may be added at some point in the future.

For a items on our roadmap, look at [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z0BD3hXVslzn5acJ_5KomH_WkwnMeQ9gEiJh3z79fHE/edit).

## Installation

At this moment, the tool works as a Glyphs.app script. To install the tool:

1. Install the DrawBot plugin using the built-in Plugin Manager in Glyphs.app. This tool uses drawbot to prepare proofs, so it requires you to have that library installed and available to Glyphs.app.

2. Clone this git repository into your Glyphs.app Scripts directory. This is the same folder where your `_GlyphsScripts` folder lives, for example. It's usually somewhere like `~/Library/Application Support/Glyphs/Scripts`. (The `~` is your user's home folder, something like `/Users/nic`, for example).

3. Restart Glyphs.
